# Full-stack Engineer Coding Test

The aim of this test is for us to be able to assess your ablity to build APIs and model entities. We will use it as the basis of a discussion in the next interview stage. There are no trick questions or hard rules on what you need to do.

## Brief

We would like you to create the APIs and entities required to play a game of [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).

At a minimum, players will need to interact with the following APIs:
- Placing a ship
- Calling a shot (and receiving an appropriate response e.g. `hit`, `miss` or `sunk`)

You don't need to build a frontend (feel free to if you have time) but think about the data a frontend would need from your API responses. The game state can exist in memory, there is no need to use persistent storage.

You shouldn't need to spend more than a couple of hours on this but for bonus points, you could think about how lobbies and matchmaking might work in your game.

## Technology

Ideally we would like to see your project built using Node or PHP but you can use any language or framework you feel comfortable with.

## Deliverable

Please email us once you have completed the task and invite us to view the repository. Be sure to include a set of instructions on how to install dependencies and run the project.

If you have any questions please email [tudor@blackbullion.com](mailto:tudor@blackbullion.com)
